            <div class="about-box">
                Hey! I'm Marcus De Maria, an aspiring Mechatronics Engineer in his third year at McMaster University interested in the efficient and optimized development of various tools and processes in the tech, automotive, and industrial industries.
                <br><br>
                As an aspiring undergraduate and coworker, I am passionate about my chosen field of study and would like to complement my studies with as much hands-on experience as I can. I find fulfillment in my educational pursuits and hope to spread positive change through software optimization/automation as well as the mechanical design of various engineered tools and systems, combined with various testing and data analysis techniques to curate perfected results.
                <br><br>
                Relevant experience and passion for product design, product testing, data analysis, optimization, automation, and task validation/documentation.
                <br><br>
                In my spare time, you can find me at the gym, a new coffee shop, thrifting, playing/watching sports, or connecting with new people with similar interests as mine!
